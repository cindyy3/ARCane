    <p class="description">More and more people are losing interest in art and choosing to invest in other industries.
      This in turn leads to cuts in funding for arts programs in schools, leaving students unable to partipate in or
      explore the arts, and creating an overall societal lack of interest for the arts.</p>

    <p class="description">The National Assembly of State Arts Agencies (NASAA) is a non-profit organization located in
      Washington D.C. that is an association of the United State's 56 state and jurisdictional arts agencies. The NASAA
      publishes a revenue report twice a year which provides information on financial support for the arts and places
      individual State Art Agencies' funding within the context of national trends.</p>

    <h2 class="homeST">Why is this happening?</h2>
    <p class="description">The decreasing funding and slow disappearance of art courses in high schools is recognized by
      many organizations in states across the United States. For instance, Pepperdine University and State Impact
      (Oklahoma) by the National Public Radio (NPR) published articles on the decline of funding for the arts.
      Pepperdine University is a private research university located in California. The NPR is a nonprofit media
      organization headquartered in Washington D.C.</p>

          <li>It is challenging to prove that an arts education is needed, as there aren’t standardized tests that can
            quantify its value.</li>
          <br>
          <li>Funding for the arts is complex. In the U.S., the art industry is not controlled by a single person or
            agency. Instead, a combination of federal, state, regional and local agencies provide financing for the
            arts.</li>
          <br>
          <li>One big hurdle in maintaining these programs is the difficulty of finding certified arts teachers,
            especially in rural districts.</li>

    <h2 class="homeST">What now?</h2>
    <p class="description">Due to cuts in governmental funding, the role of individuals have become greatly significant
      in helping students receive art education. For example, public schools collect fees from students that participate
      in the arts. A common example is band and orchestra. Outside of school, there are organizations that work to
      provide students opportunities to engage in art. Try looking through some of these organizations and engage!</p>
