      <div class="text">
        <p><br>I want to be whisked away to Arizona <br>
and kissed in the depression of the Earth. <br>
Surrounded by rocks that have heard the moans of creatures like me, <br>
long necked <br>
and ferocious <br>
slow-stepping, and extraordinary. <br>
<br>
Standing ankle-deep in oceans of sand <br>
Under sun that refuses to give up <br>
Sharing heat with someone that loves me, <br>
that sees me as a beginning and the now, <br>
their future and their lover from a past life <br>
  <br>
I want to love in Arizona. <br>
  <br>
I want my palms and shoulders and the back of my neck <br>
bathed in sunlight and lips <br>
To fall asleep in a city of cacti <br>
and kept awake by all the life that romps in the night <br>
  <br>
I want to walk into the chilly desert draped under your arm, <br>
blanketed by all of you and all of the stars <br>
that seem more like ancestors, <br>
winking and beaming down at us, <br>
granting me the wish that has lived in my skeleton since my conception: <br>
to be loved unconditionally <br>
a freedom they’ve prayed over me endlessly. <br>
  <br>
I want the stars and the moon <br>
and the lizards and the dirt <br>
and the fingers and their touch <br>
and the promise of forever, <br>
  <br>
in Arizona.</p>

        <p><br>Pretty women wonder where my secret lies. <br>
I'm not cute or built to suit a fashion model's size <br>
But when I start to tell them, <br>
They think I'm telling lies. <br>
I say, <br>
It's in the reach of my arms <br>
The span of my hips, <br>
The stride of my step, <br>
The curl of my lips. <br>
I'm a woman <br>
Phenomenally. <br>
Phenomenal woman, <br>
That's me. <br>
<br>
I walk into a room <br>
Just as cool as you please, <br>
And to a man, <br>
The fellows stand or <br>
Fall down on their knees. <br>
Then they swarm around me, <br>
A hive of honey bees. <br>
I say, <br>
It's the fire in my eyes, <br>
And the flash of my teeth, <br>
The swing in my waist, <br>
And the joy in my feet. <br>
I'm a woman <br>
Phenomenally. <br>
Phenomenal woman, <br>
That's me. <br>
<br>
Men themselves have wondered <br>
What they see in me. <br>
They try so much <br>
But they can't touch <br>
My inner mystery. <br>
When I try to show them <br>
They say they still can't see. <br>
I say, <br>
It's in the arch of my back, <br>
The sun of my smile, <br>
The ride of my breasts, <br>
The grace of my style. <br>
I'm a woman <br>
 <br>
Phenomenally. <br>
Phenomenal woman, <br>
That's me. <br>
<br>
Now you understand <br>
Just why my head's not bowed. <br>
I don't shout or jump about <br>
Or have to talk real loud. <br>
When you see me passing <br>
It ought to make you proud. <br>
I say, <br>
It's in the click of my heels, <br>
The bend of my hair, <br>
the palm of my hand, <br>
The need of my care, <br>
'Cause I'm a woman <br>
Phenomenally. <br>
Phenomenal woman, <br>
That's me.</p>

      <div class="text">
        <p><br>In an effort to get people to look <br>
into each other’s eyes more, <br>
and also to appease the mutes, <br>
the government has decided <br>
to allot each person exactly one hundred <br>
and sixty-seven words, per day. <br>
<br>
When the phone rings, I put it to my ear <br>
without saying hello. In the restaurant <br>
I point at chicken noodle soup. <br>
I am adjusting well to the new way. <br>
<br>
Late at night, I call my long distance lover, <br>
proudly say I only used fifty-nine today. <br>
I saved the rest for you. <br>
<br>
When she doesn’t respond, <br>
I know she’s used up all her words, <br>
so I slowly whisper I love you <br>
thirty-two and a third times. <br>
After that, we just sit on the line <br>
and listen to each other breathe. <br>

        <p><br>If I should die, <br>
And you should live, <br>
And time should gurgle on, <br>

’T is sweet to know that stocks will stand <br>
When we with daisies lie, <br>
That commerce will continue, <br>

It makes the parting tranquil <br>
And keeps the soul serene, <br>
That gentlemen so sprightly <br>
Conduct the pleasing scene!</p>

        <p><br>Last night we killed a possum, <br>
out of mercy, in the middle of the road. <br>
<br>
It was dying, its face was bloody, <br>
the back legs were shattered. The mistake <br>
<br>
I made was getting out of the car <br>
(you told me not to), but I wanted to be <br>
<br>
sure, needed to know for sure, that it could <br>
not be saved. (Someone else had hit it.) <br>
 <br>
The sound it was making. The sound <br>
folded me back into the airless car. <br>
<br>
Do it, do it fast, I lowered my head <br>
until the thud was done. You killed it quiet. <br>
<br>
We drove home under the sickle moon, <br>
laundry gone cold and dry on the line. <br>
<br>
But that was last night. This morning <br>
the sun is coming alive in the kitchen. <br>
<br>
You’ve gone to get us gas station coffee <br>
and there is so much life all over the place.</p>

        <p><br>Do not go gentle into that good night, <br>
Old age should burn and rave at close of day; <br>
Rage, rage against the dying of the light. <br>
<br>
Though wise men at their end know dark is right, <br>
Because their words had forked no lightning they <br>
Do not go gentle into that good night. <br>
 <br>
Good men, the last wave by, crying how bright <br>
Their frail deeds might have danced in a green bay, <br>
Rage, rage against the dying of the light. <br>
<br>
Wild men who caught and sang the sun in flight, <br>
And learn, too late, they grieved it on its way, <br>
Do not go gentle into that good night. <br>
<br>
Grave men, near death, who see with blinding sight <br>
Blind eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay, <br>
Rage, rage against the dying of the light. <br>
<br>
And you, my father, there on the sad height, <br>
Curse, bless, me now with your fierce tears, I pray. <br>
Do not go gentle into that good night. <br>
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.</p>

        <p><br>I met a traveller from an antique land <br>
Who said: "Two vast and trunkless legs of stone <br>
Stand in the desert . . . Near them, on the sand, <br>
Half sunk, a shattered visage lies, whose frown, <br>
And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command, <br>
Tell that its sculptor well those passions read <br>
Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things, <br>
The hand that mocked them, and the heart that fed: <br>
And on the pedestal these words appear: <br>
'My name is Ozymandias, king of kings: <br>
Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!' <br>
Nothing beside remains. Round the decay <br>
Of that colossal wreck, boundless and bare <br>
The lone and level sands stretch far away."</p>

      <div class="text">
        <p><br>The guardian angel sits in the tree <br>
above the black lip of street <br>
the man walks down. <br>
He calls the man Cargo. <br>
<br>
The angel sees a pinewood box in place of the man, <br>
and the street he walks is a boat, <br>
the hull like a coal crater. <br>
<br>
Somewhere in the real world there is such a boat and box. <br>
<br>
The angels call these overlays dreams, <br>
and believe they crop up because angels <br>
can’t sleep but want to — <br>
<br>
space falls apart when you have unlimited time. <br>
<br>
The cargo is rattling in the boat. <br>
Maybe it’s just the waves, maybe it’s rats. <br>
What’s the difference? Either way: it’s the box. <br>
<br>
The angel sends the man <br>
a happy vision from his past — the time <br>
<br>
he fed birthday cake <br>
to his goldfish <br>
after an unsuccessful party. <br>
<br>
The angel thinks he’s applying lemon oil <br>
to the creaky, wounded wood of the box. <br>
He knows it’s palliative, but it’s beautiful. <br>
<br>
The man reaches the end of the street. He’s a sick man <br>
and he starts to ponder death <br>
as he often does these days: <br>
<br>
All of death is right here <br>
— the gods, the dark, a moon. <br>
Where was I expecting death <br>
to take me if everywhere it is <br>
is on earth? <br>
<br>
At life’s close, you’re like the child whose parents <br>
step out for a drive — <br>
<br>
everyone else out on a trip, <br>
but the child remains in the familiar bed, <br>
feeling old lumps like new <br>
in the mattress — the lights off — <br>
<br>
not sleeping, for who can sleep <br>
with the promise of a world beyond the door? <br>
<br>
That night the child dreams <br>
he’s inside the box. <br>
<br>
It’s burning hot, the heat coming <br>
from bugs and worms <br>
raping and devouring one another. <br>
<br>
He starts the hard work <br>
of the imagination, <br>
learning to minister to the new dream. <br>
<br>
Perhaps all that’s needed is a little rain — <br>
for everyone to drink and have a bath. <br>
<br>
Outside: a car humming, <br>
somewhere, his mother’s singing. <br>

      <div class="text">
        <p><br>Six humans trapped by happenstance <br>
In bleak and bitter cold. <br>
Each one possessed a stick of wood <br>
Or so the story's told. <br>
<br>
Their dying fire in need of logs <br>
The first man held his back <br>
For of the faces around the fire <br>
He noticed one was black. <br>
<br>
The next man looking 'cross the way <br>
Saw one not of his church <br>
And couldn't bring himself to give <br>
The fire his stick of birch. <br>
<br>
The third one sat in tattered clothes <br>
He gave his coat a hitch <br>
Why should his log be put to use <br>
To warm the idle rich? <br>
<br>
The rich man just sat back thought <br>
Of the wealth he had in store <br>
And how to keep what he had earned <br>
From the lazy shiftless poor. <br>
<br>
The black man's face bespoke revenge <br>
As the fire passed from his sight <br>
For all he saw in his stick of wood <br>
Was a chance to spite the white. <br>
<br>
The last man of this forlorn group <br>
Did nought except for gain <br>
Giving only to those who gave <br>
Was how he played the game. <br>
<br>
Their logs held tight in death's still hands <br>
Was proof of human sin <br>
They did not die from the cold without <br>
They died from the cold within.</p>
